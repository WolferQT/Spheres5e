At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a normal range of 20 feet, long range of 60 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the @UUID[Compendium.wolfer-spheres5e.destruction.F99bWFFsg8WeBIMX]{destructive blast}. Even if thrown through a weapon, it deals only the @UUID[Compendium.wolfer-spheres5e.destruction.F99bWFFsg8WeBIMX]{destructive blast} damage, and the attack cannot be used with the Striking (metasphere) talent. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes. A creature may shatter a globe within its reach as an action or bonus action or by spending 5 feet of movement while moving through the globe’s space. Creatures unaware of the globe that move through its space have a 50% chance of shattering it. You cannot have more globes made at a time than your proficiency bonus, and you can treat a globe as if it were an @UUID[Compendium.wolfer-spheres5e.might.CinDayelyOXjoMfB]{Alchemy sphere} <strong>formula</strong> that may be thrown for the purpose of interacting with the Trap sphere.</p><p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> When using the globe augment, the globe persists for 8 hours. If you are within destructive blast range of the globe, you can cause it to explode as a reaction. At the end of this time, it explodes or dissipates. This choice is made at the time of casting.</p><p><strong>Augment 1 sp:</strong> The affected area is instead a sphere with a radius of up to 20 feet.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Spheres of Power","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":"inst"},"cover":null,"target":{"value":5,"width":null,"units":"ft","type":"cube"},"range":{"value":30,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"attribute","target":"","amount":0},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[["1d8",""]],"versatile":""},"formula":"1d8 + floor(@details.level/2)d8","save":{"ability":"dex","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":0,"school":"","components":{"vocal":false,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"atwill","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"cantrip","formula":"floor((@details.level + 1)/6)d8"}},"img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"jvc9MjSXj7pOw4bp":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.kZj5NMy8ZD5m3zYG.Item.AUAK2M89tavwsw5G"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1685269710235,"modifiedTime":1685901053090,"lastModifiedBy":"jvc9MjSXj7pOw4bp"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"xdqddK4w15AZsmq1"}

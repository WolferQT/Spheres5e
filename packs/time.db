All effects on the creature or object have their duration decreased by a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus([[@prof]]) each round. This also decreases the maximum length of time an effect (other than this one) can be concentrated on.

Unwilling targets (including allies if they choose) are allowed a [[/r 1d20 + @abilities.wis.save]]{Wisdom} saving throw to negate this effect.
